# Eye_Controlled_Mouse_project
The above project uses face and eye tracking technology to control a computer mouse. It captures the user's face through the webcam, tracks their eye movements, and maps them to the movement of the mouse on the screen. The user can move the mouse pointer and click by moving their eyes and blinking. This project can be useful for people with disabilities or anyone who wants to control their computer without using their hands.
